<p> See this point: mmm553m. I should be careful not to tell stories and then "explain" to the reader why these actors act how they act. As in "see, they cut out corners of the receipt, because this allows them to do ...". I mean, I can of course report on why they themselves say why do they do what they do. I can speculate on why they do what they do. But to add to the statement "actor x does this" the statement "which is of course only logical because of this" is to take agency away. I wouldn't feel comfortable if someone did that to me. It is not innocent in terms of power and control. It's not modest. It's not nice. It doesn't fit my politics/sentiments. The goal isn't really explanation then, is it?

<p> mmm1580m (i10r): Is the model APMC act a good idea then? Let's look at it from the perspective of the farmers: I guess it's good to keep the APMC as attractive place to overflow to (to keep the malls on their toes when it comes to their relations with farmers). For which you would still need the APMC tax. The power of the APMC should be used to reduce the malpractices (i.e. power) of the agents. (But you would then require some kind of 'good governance' of course). I guess the arrival of the malls isn't too bad either, as this gives farmers more options to overflow to. Still, this is not pushing the price for the farmers up too much. Partly, I guess, because the malls don't have to steal away that many farmers from the APMC (because of the dissapointing performance of this tandem mmm1581m). Partly because they don't have the scale/incumbency/relations yet, partly because they have their own malpractices?
